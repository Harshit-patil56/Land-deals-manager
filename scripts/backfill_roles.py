"""
Backfill payment_parties.role using simple heuristics.
- If party.role is already present, skip.
- Heuristics (conservative):
  * If payment.party_type == 'owner' and there is at least one investor party: mark investor(s) as payer, owner(s) as payee.
  * If payment.party_type == 'investor' and there is at least one owner party: mark investor(s) as payer, owner(s) as payee.
  * If only owners present and amount < 50000, mark owner as payee and role='payee' (document/fee scenario) â€” conservative.
  * Otherwise, leave NULL.
Usage: set DB env vars or rely on .env; then run with python scripts/backfill_roles.py
